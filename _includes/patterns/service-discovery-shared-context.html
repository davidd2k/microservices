<p>Services typically need to call one another.
In a monolithic application, services invoke one another through language-level method or procedure calls.
In a traditional distributed system deployment, services run at fixed, well known locations (hosts and ports) and so can easily call one another using HTTP/REST or some RPC mechanism.
However, a modern <a href="microservices.html">microservice-based</a> application typically runs in a virtualized or containerized environments where the number of instances of a service and their locations changes dynamically.
Consequently, you must implement a mechanism for that enables the clients of service to make requests to a dynamically changing set of ephemeral service instances.</p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>How does the client of a service - the API gateway or another service - discover the location of a service instance?</p>

<h2 id="forces">Forces</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Each instance of a service exposes a remote API such as HTTP/REST, or Thrift etc. at a particular location (host and port)</li>
  <li>The number of services instances and their locations changes dynamically. </li>
  <li>Virtual machines and containers are usually assigned a dynamic IP address. An EC2 Autoscaling Group, for example, adjusts the number of instances based on load. </li>
</ul>
