Today, there are several trends that are forcing application architectures to evolve.
Users expect a rich, interactive and dynamic user experience on a wide variety of clients including mobile devices.
Applications must be highly scalable, highly available and run on cloud environments.
Organizations often want to frequently roll out updates, even multiple times a day.
Consequently, itâ€™s no longer adequate to develop simple, monolithic web applications that serve up HTML to desktop browsers.

This site describes a new, alternative architecture: microservices.
Applications with a microservice architecture consist of a set of narrowly focused, independently deployable services.
Read on to find out more about this approach and its associated trade-offs.
A good starting point is the [Monolithic Architecture pattern](/patterns/monolithic.html).
