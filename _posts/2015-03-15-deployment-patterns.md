I've added the following deployment patterns:

# Deployment patterns

* [Multiple service instances per host](/patterns/deployment/multiple-services-per-host.html) - deploy multiple service instances on a host
* [Service instance per host](/patterns/deployment/single-service-per-host.html) - deploy a single service instance on each host
* [Service instance per VM](/patterns/deployment/service-per-vm.html) - a specialization of the Service Instance per Host pattern where the host is a VM
* [Service instance per Container](/patterns/deployment/service-per-container.html) - a specialization of the Service Instance per Host pattern where the host is a container
