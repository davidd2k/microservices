[Chris Richardson](http://twitter.com/crichardson) has published the example code for his [QCONSF talk on building event-driven microservices](http://plainoldobjects.com/presentations/building-and-deploying-microservices-with-event-sourcing-cqrs-and-docker/). 
The [example microservices-based application](https://github.com/cer/event-sourcing-examples) is built using [event sourcing and command query responsibility separation (CQRS)](https://github.com/cer/event-sourcing-examples/wiki/WhyEventSourcing).
There are currently two versions of the application - Scala/Spring and Java/Spring - with others to follow.
Take a look!
