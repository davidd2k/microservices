* My article on [Building Microservices: Inter-Process Communication in a Microservices Architecture](https://www.nginx.com/blog/building-microservices-inter-process-communication/) is now available
* There was recently a discussion about [microservices on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9857288). Lots of great comments.
* There was an interesting Twitter discussion about the role of integration platforms in a microservices architecture.
