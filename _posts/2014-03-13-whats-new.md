Welcome to the first of what is hopefully a regular roundup of what's new and relevant in the world of [microservices](/patterns/microservices.html). In the past week:

* Russ Miles ([@russmiles](https://twitter.com/russmiles)) announced [µCon](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6312-mucon), the first conference about microservices.
It takes place in London on November 27th-28th.

* Martin Fowler ([@martinfowler](https://twitter.com/martinfowler)) published the final installments of his in-depth [article about microservices](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html).

* Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz compared [microservices with SOA](http://arnon.me/2014/03/services-microservices-nanoservices) and argued that "microservices" is not a good term.

* Gawain Hammond ([@gawainhammond](https://twitter.com/gawainhammond)) wrote a [blog post on microservices](http://gawainhammond.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/microservices-and-soa.html) defending the term "microservices".

* [@rrees](https://twitter.com/rrees) wrote in interesting summary of a [session on microservices](http://rrees.me/2014/03/24/the-state-of-microservices/) at the Scale Summit.

* Chris Richardson ([@crichardson](https://twitter.com/crichardson)) published [Thoughts about #microservices – less micro, more service?](Thoughts about #microservices – less micro, more service?)
that suggested that there should be more emphasis on "service" and less on "micro".

* There was also the ongoing [twitter discussion](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23microservices).

And then there was this:
